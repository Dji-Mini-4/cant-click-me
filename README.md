### How to play

So the goal is to click on the button... simple, right?  
BUT, if you hover on top of the button too long, an alert would pop up, therfore you have to close that alert and
try again.  
The delay for the alert is set in the start, but a button on the top-right can reset it to a different amount.
Hope you'll have fun!

Also cloud implementation is coming up! You can make highscores, and people _hopefully_ can see you on the rank list!
